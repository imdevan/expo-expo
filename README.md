This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

The goal of this project is jump start Expo app development with all the bells and whistles that I personally would want to see in a production web-first React Native app.

Inspired primarily by [Next Launch](https://github.com/imdevan/next-launch), [Take Out](https://tamagui.dev/takeout), and [Next-js-Boilerplate](https://github.com/ixartz/Next-js-Boilerplate/tree/main).

I've considered [Expo Boilerplate](https://github.com/Milvasoft/expo-boilerplate) and [React-Native-Boilerplate](https://github.com/thecodingmachine/react-native-boilerplate). But for various reasons neither of those met my specific needs or DX interests.

Please consider using this boilerplate for you next React Native / React Native Web project if the features on [The Roadmap](#-roadmap-) seem interesting to you.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   yarn expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
