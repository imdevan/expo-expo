This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

The goal of this project is jump start Expo app development with all the bells and whistles that I would want to see in a production web app.

Inspired by [Next Launch](https://github.com/imdevan/next-launch) and [Take Out](https://tamagui.dev/takeout)

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   yarn expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Learn more
